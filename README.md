Validation of Impedance Test Tube Model in Ansys Harmonic Analysis

Software Version: Ansys 2025 R1 Student Edition 

The Model is validated with SAC of Kenaf Fiber of thickness of 40 mm. The Johnson-Champoux-Allard(JCA) Model is used for modeling of Acoustic material. The JCA Model requires five parameters, namely, Porosity, Tortuosity, Air Flow Resistivity, Viscous Characteristic Length and Thermal Characteristic Length to predict the sound absorption coefficient of an acoustic material. The validated model yielded RMSE value of 0.026515.

The parameter values were taken from existing research by:
